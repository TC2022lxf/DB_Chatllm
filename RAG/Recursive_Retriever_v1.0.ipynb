It is a \"terminal-centric\" solution that requires only minimal additional support from the UTRAN, GERAN and Core Network. There are 3 main components to the solution:\\r\\n\\r\\na)\\tSwitching between voice and video during an established call is achieved by one UE releasing the voice (or video) call and then that UE establishing a video (or voice) call with the same destination UE.\\r\\n\\r\\nb)\\tDuring a video call, the radio coverage at one end may degrade such that the video call cannot be maintained. In this case the video call will be released, and, the UE that initiated the video call can offer to its user an attempt to establish a voice call with the other party.\\r\\n\\r\\nc)\\tThe initial establishment of a video call may be unsuccessful, in which case the A party can automatically establish a voice call.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all these 3 cases, optimisation of the Man Machine Interface in the UE is possible and desirable.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE:\\tThere may be tradeoffs between \\'speed of redial\\' and interactions with content servers that only support video calls. In particular, the use of the term \"automatic\" does not prevent the UE requesting confirmation from the user.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not the intention of this TR to specify the MMI of UEs, however, this TR does describe some MMI actions solely for the purpose of easing the description of the procedures.\\r\\n\\r', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='5e5bc180-eae1-4a30-81f2-a5fc371ee2b5', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='\\n\\n4.2\\tUser initiated switching during an established call\\n\\r', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='418f4a0f-a547-4115-971f-6379817f770c', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='\\n\\n4.2.1\\tSignalling flows and procedures\\n\\r\\nThe successful case of the \"B party initiated switch to video\" for UMTS is illustrated in Figure\\xa01. The notation \"UE 1\" and \"UE 2\" is used (rather than A and B party) because, if the B party (of the voice call) presses the \"switch to video\" button, it then becomes the A party of the subsequent video call.\\r\\n\\r\\n!本地路径\\r\\n[Figure_Placeholder]C:\\\\Users\\\\YIXUAN ZHANG\\\\OneDrive\\\\桌面\\\\23903-i00-image3.png[/Figure_Placeholder]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFigure\\xa01: B party initiated switch to video\\r\\n\\r\\n0)\\tThe UEs are in a voice call initiated by UE 1. Following verbal dialogue between User 1 and User 2, they agree that a switch to video is likely to be successful (e.g. because both User 1 and User 2 have video capable handsets, and, they both have \"using 3G\" indications visible on their screens). The User of UE 2 pushes the \"switch to video\" button (or uses other MMI that provides the same functionality) and UE 2 stores the CLI of UE 1 for use in step 7.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE\\xa01:\\tIf UE 1 (instead of UE 2) initiated the \"switch to video\", then UE 1 stores the previously dialled number for use in step 7.\\r\\n\\r\\n1)\\tUE 2 releases the voice call.\\r\\n\\r\\n2)\\tMSC 2 sends a RELEASE message with the release cause. The cause value in the RELEASE message might be changed by transit networks prior to arrival at MSC 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n3)\\tMSC 1 sends a RELEASE COMPLETE message to MSC 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n4)\\tMSC 1 releases the voice call with UE 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n5)\\tMSC 2 and MSC 1 locally release the Iu connections to RNC 2 and RNC 1 (assuming that there are no other CM connections active). RNC 2 and RNC 1 then release the RRC connections (assuming that their mobiles are not in PMM connected state).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn order to minimise idle tasks performed by the UE, the following should be performed by Operators which preferentially camp UEs on UMTS:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tthe BSC should include the \"Cell selection indicator after release of all TCH and SDCCH\" IE in the Channel Release message (see TS\\xa044.018\\xa0[2]) if the release is done on a GERAN cell and the call was not started on this BSC and the local 2G and 3G cells are in different RAs.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE\\xa02:\\tThe above text does mean RA. Change of LA always involves change of RA.\\r\\n\\r\\n6)\\tUE 2 and UE 1 camp on suitable cells and perform the required idle mode tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\n7)\\tUE 2 initiates RRC connection setup and sends the Setup message for the video call to MSC 2. The Called Party number is the one stored in step 0. The Setup message should carry extra information to indicate that it is the result of a redial attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\n8)\\tMSC 2 requests the allocation of radio resources.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIf the GERAN does not support CS video, then the MSC 2 shall send an A interface Assignment Request message to the BSC including the Service Handover IE set to \"Handover to UTRAN or cdma2000 should be performed\" and a Channel Type indicating any value acceptable to the BSC. The BSS handles the Assignment Request message as defined in TS\\xa048.008\\xa0[3]. The interactions between MSC server and MGW can be minimised if the A interface circuit is not allocated. This can be achieved by setting the Channel Type = signalling. The interactions between the MSC server and the MGW are defined in TS\\xa023.205\\xa0[12].\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIf the GERAN does support CS video then the MSC 2 should send an A interface Assignment Request message to the BSC including the relevant channel type. The BSS proceeds as defined in TS\\xa048.008\\xa0[3].\\r\\n\\r\\n9)\\tIf radio resource allocation was successful, the IAM message is sent to MSC 1 and the Call Proceeding message is sent to UE 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n10)\\tMSC 1 pages UE 1. UE 1 responds by establishing an RRC connection and sending the Paging Response message to MSC 1 within the RRC-Initial Direct Transfer and RANAP-Initial UE messages. MSC 1 then sends the Setup message for the video call to UE 1. The Setup message carries the CLI of UE 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n11) UE 1 confirms its capability to handle the video call in the Call Confirmed message and MSC 1 requests the allocation of radio resources.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIf UE 1 responded to paging by establishing an RR connection on a GERAN cell, then MSC 1 initiates handover to UTRAN as described in step 8.\\r\\n\\r\\n12)\\tIf the radio resource allocation was successful, UE 1 sends an Alerting message to MSC 1. MSC 1 sends the ACM message to MSC 2 and MSC 2 sends the Alerting message to UE 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n13)\\tUser 1 answers the video call. For privacy reasons, the \"switch to video\" and \"switch to voice\" answer functions should not be automated.\\r\\n\\r\\n14)\\tThe video call is established.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith obvious small differences, some of which are described above, the above procedure is also used for switching from a video call to a voice call.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE\\xa03:\\tWhen \"redial-switching\" from a video call to a voice call, the voice call Setup message should carry the extra information to indicate that it is a redial attempt.\\r\\n\\r', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='5eefca1e-b5ae-4d81-b656-e7ecf1065fac', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='\\n\\n4.2.2\\tFuture enhancements\\n\\r', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='cca8cd83-f773-48ed-8018-f5be05dc3e8d', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text=\"\\n\\n4.2.2.1\\tDetection of video calling capability during a voice call\\n\\r\\nAs a minimum, it will be useful if mobiles can indicate whether they are using UMTS for their ongoing voice call.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever additional functionality would be useful, specifically:\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\twhen using UTRAN, an indication of whether 64 kbit/s video can be supported in the mobile's current location;\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\twhen using GERAN, an indication of whether UMTS coverage is available, and, ideally whether the UMTS coverage can support 64 kbit/s video.\\r\\n\\r\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='2c162304-741e-4e46-9df7-085230a52430', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='\\n\\n4.3\\tFallback to voice during an established video call\\n\\r', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='fa2208e2-9892-4232-88d5-bc46c129afff', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='\\n\\n4.3.1\\tSignalling flows and procedures\\n\\r', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='ac3fdaaf-fc1b-454b-8f51-389186f040bc', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='\\n\\n4.3.1.1\\tFallback from UTRAN Video to UTRAN Voice call\\n\\r\\nThe successful case of the \"radio degradation at UE 2 leading to fallback to voice\" for UMTS is illustrated in Figure\\xa02.\\r\\n\\r\\n!本地路径\\r\\n[Figure_Placeholder]C:\\\\Users\\\\YIXUAN ZHANG\\\\OneDrive\\\\桌面\\\\23903-i00-image4.png[/Figure_Placeholder]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFigure\\xa02: Radio degradation at UE 2 leading to fallback to voice\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE\\xa01:\\tFigure 2 does not show all of the RRC and Iu connection establishment messages.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\tRNC 2 is configured such that it knows that the local GERAN does not (or does) support video calls (i.e. does not (or does) support 64 kbit/s conversational QoS on the CS domain).\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE\\xa02:\\tFor an interim period, an alternative solution is that MSC 2 sets the Service Handover IE to \\'Handover to GSM shall not be performed\\' in the RAB Assignment Request message.

However there are additional complications:\\r\\n\\r\\na)\\tIf the UTRAN and GERAN cells are attached to different MSCs then problems are likely to occur due to the time required for the UE 2 to perform Location Area and Routeing Area updating.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn particular, if UE 2 is updating with a new MSC and/or new SGSN, UE 2 will not respond to MSC 2\\'s paging. This will only become known to UE 1 when MSC 2\\'s \"no response to paging\" timer expires. Typically, an operator configures this timer with values in the range of 8 to 25 seconds. When this timer expires, it is quite likely that UE 2 will have \"call forward on not reachable\" set and so UE 1\\'s call will be diverted to a voice mail server. To avoid these problems, it seems important that the operator configures the UTRAN to minimise the number of video calls that lead to fallback to GERAN coverage and/or to configure the network such that geographically similar UTRAN and GERAN cells are in the same Routeing Area.\\r\\n\\r\\nb)\\tIn order to avoid useless handover attempts, the RNCs are frequently configured so that no GERAN neighbour cells are given to the mobile during a video call. This will slow down re-selection from 3G to 2G in the case of total loss of 3G coverage. Conversely, in many other scenarios the lack of 2G neighbour cells might force UE 2 to camp on the 3G cell for long enough for it to receive the paging for the voice call.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tOverall, the operator may need to adapt the neighbour cell lists provided in video calls on cell by cell basis and/or dependent upon whether or not combined 2G/3G MSCs AND combined SGSNs are in use.\\r\\n\\r', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='a40b629e-c83c-4826-b64b-4b028f7e1c48', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='\\n\\n4.3.2\\tFuture enhancements\\n\\r', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='631555ab-d9a3-449d-b43d-04204154c0f8', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text=\"\\n\\n4.3.2.1\\tRRC behaviour following degradation of the video RAB\\n\\r\\nAdditional study may be beneficial on how to 'synchronise' the release of the RRC connection in the RNC and in the mobile when the radio connection is degraded or lost.

It is a \"terminal-centric\" solution that requires only minimal additional support from the UTRAN, GERAN and Core Network. There are 3 main components to the solution:\\r\\n\\r\\na)\\tSwitching between voice and video during an established call is achieved by one UE releasing the voice (or video) call and then that UE establishing a video (or voice) call with the same destination UE.\\r\\n\\r\\nb)\\tDuring a video call, the radio coverage at one end may degrade such that the video call cannot be maintained. In this case the video call will be released, and, the UE that initiated the video call can offer to its user an attempt to establish a voice call with the other party.\\r\\n\\r\\nc)\\tThe initial establishment of a video call may be unsuccessful, in which case the A party can automatically establish a voice call.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all these 3 cases, optimisation of the Man Machine Interface in the UE is possible and desirable.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE:\\tThere may be tradeoffs between \\'speed of redial\\' and interactions with content servers that only support video calls. In particular, the use of the term \"automatic\" does not prevent the UE requesting confirmation from the user.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not the intention of this TR to specify the MMI of UEs, however, this TR does describe some MMI actions solely for the purpose of easing the description of the procedures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2\\tUser initiated switching during an established call\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2.1\\tSignalling flows and procedures\\n\\r\\nThe successful case of the \"B party initiated switch to video\" for UMTS is illustrated in Figure\\xa01. The notation \"UE 1\" and \"UE 2\" is used (rather than A and B party) because, if the B party (of the voice call) presses the \"switch to video\" button, it then becomes the A party of the subsequent video call.\\r\\n\\r\\n!本地路径\\r\\n[Figure_Placeholder]C:\\\\Users\\\\YIXUAN ZHANG\\\\OneDrive\\\\桌面\\\\23903-i00-image3.png[/Figure_Placeholder]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFigure\\xa01: B party initiated switch to video\\r\\n\\r\\n0)\\tThe UEs are in a voice call initiated by UE 1. Following verbal dialogue between User 1 and User 2, they agree that a switch to video is likely to be successful (e.g. because both User 1 and User 2 have video capable handsets, and, they both have \"using 3G\" indications visible on their screens). The User of UE 2 pushes the \"switch to video\" button (or uses other MMI that provides the same functionality) and UE 2 stores the CLI of UE 1 for use in step 7.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE\\xa01:\\tIf UE 1 (instead of UE 2) initiated the \"switch to video\", then UE 1 stores the previously dialled number for use in step 7.\\r\\n\\r\\n1)\\tUE 2 releases the voice call.\\r\\n\\r\\n2)\\tMSC 2 sends a RELEASE message with the release cause. The cause value in the RELEASE message might be changed by transit networks prior to arrival at MSC 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n3)\\tMSC 1 sends a RELEASE COMPLETE message to MSC 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n4)\\tMSC 1 releases the voice call with UE 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n5)\\tMSC 2 and MSC 1 locally release the Iu connections to RNC 2 and RNC 1 (assuming that there are no other CM connections active). RNC 2 and RNC 1 then release the RRC connections (assuming that their mobiles are not in PMM connected state).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn order to minimise idle tasks performed by the UE, the following should be performed by Operators which preferentially camp UEs on UMTS:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tthe BSC should include the \"Cell selection indicator after release of all TCH and SDCCH\" IE in the Channel Release message (see TS\\xa044.018\\xa0[2]) if the release is done on a GERAN cell and the call was not started on this BSC and the local 2G and 3G cells are in different RAs.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE\\xa02:\\tThe above text does mean RA. Change of LA always involves change of RA.\\r\\n\\r\\n6)\\tUE 2 and UE 1 camp on suitable cells and perform the required idle mode tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\n7)\\tUE 2 initiates RRC connection setup and sends the Setup message for the video call to MSC 2. The Called Party number is the one stored in step 0. The Setup message should carry extra information to indicate that it is the result of a redial attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\n8)\\tMSC 2 requests the allocation of radio resources.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIf the GERAN does not support CS video, then the MSC 2 shall send an A interface Assignment Request message to the BSC including the Service Handover IE set to \"Handover to UTRAN or cdma2000 should be performed\" and a Channel Type indicating any value acceptable to the BSC. The BSS handles the Assignment Request message as defined in TS\\xa048.008\\xa0[3]. The interactions between MSC server and MGW can be minimised if the A interface circuit is not allocated. This can be achieved by setting the Channel Type = signalling. The interactions between the MSC server and the MGW are defined in TS\\xa023.205\\xa0[12].\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIf the GERAN does support CS video then the MSC 2 should send an A interface Assignment Request message to the BSC including the relevant channel type. The BSS proceeds as defined in TS\\xa048.008\\xa0[3].\\r\\n\\r\\n9)\\tIf radio resource allocation was successful, the IAM message is sent to MSC 1 and the Call Proceeding message is sent to UE 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n10)\\tMSC 1 pages UE 1. UE 1 responds by establishing an RRC connection and sending the Paging Response message to MSC 1 within the RRC-Initial Direct Transfer and RANAP-Initial UE messages. MSC 1 then sends the Setup message for the video call to UE 1. The Setup message carries the CLI of UE 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n11) UE 1 confirms its capability to handle the video call in the Call Confirmed message and MSC 1 requests the allocation of radio resources.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIf UE 1 responded to paging by establishing an RR connection on a GERAN cell, then MSC 1 initiates handover to UTRAN as described in step 8.\\r\\n\\r\\n12)\\tIf the radio resource allocation was successful, UE 1 sends an Alerting message to MSC 1. MSC 1 sends the ACM message to MSC 2 and MSC 2 sends the Alerting message to UE 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n13)\\tUser 1 answers the video call. For privacy reasons, the \"switch to video\" and \"switch to voice\" answer functions should not be automated.\\r\\n\\r\\n14)\\tThe video call is established.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith obvious small differences, some of which are described above, the above procedure is also used for switching from a video call to a voice call.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE\\xa03:\\tWhen \"redial-switching\" from a video call to a voice call, the voice call Setup message should carry the extra information to indicate that it is a redial attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2.2\\tFuture enhancements\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.2.2.1\\tDetection of video calling capability during a voice call\\n\\r\\nAs a minimum, it will be useful if mobiles can indicate whether they are using UMTS for their ongoing voice call.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever additional functionality would be useful, specifically:\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\twhen using UTRAN, an indication of whether 64 kbit/s video can be supported in the mobile\\'s current location;\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\twhen using GERAN, an indication of whether UMTS coverage is available, and, ideally whether the UMTS coverage can support 64 kbit/s video.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3\\tFallback to voice during an established video call\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.1\\tSignalling flows and procedures\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.1.1\\tFallback from UTRAN Video to UTRAN Voice call\\n\\r\\nThe successful case of the \"radio degradation at UE 2 leading to fallback to voice\" for UMTS is illustrated in Figure\\xa02.\\r\\n\\r\\n!本地路径\\r\\n[Figure_Placeholder]C:\\\\Users\\\\YIXUAN ZHANG\\\\OneDrive\\\\桌面\\\\23903-i00-image4.png[/Figure_Placeholder]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFigure\\xa02: Radio degradation at UE 2 leading to fallback to voice\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE\\xa01:\\tFigure 2 does not show all of the RRC and Iu connection establishment messages.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\tRNC 2 is configured such that it knows that the local GERAN does not (or does) support video calls (i.e. does not (or does) support 64 kbit/s conversational QoS on the CS domain).\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE\\xa02:\\tFor an interim period, an alternative solution is that MSC 2 sets the Service Handover IE to \\'Handover to GSM shall not be performed\\' in the RAB Assignment Request message. However, this solution is not future proof if (all or part of) the network\\'s GERAN is upgraded to support CS Video telephony.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWhen RNC 2 detects that the 64kbit/s bearer cannot be maintained any longer (e.g. radio link failure, TS\\xa025.331\\xa0[4]), RNC 2 sends either an Iu RELEASE REQUEST message or a RAB Release Request message to MSC 2, indicating that the Iu connection should be released\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\tMSC 2 sends a REL message with the release cause.

However there are additional complications:\\r\\n\\r\\na)\\tIf the UTRAN and GERAN cells are attached to different MSCs then problems are likely to occur due to the time required for the UE 2 to perform Location Area and Routeing Area updating.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn particular, if UE 2 is updating with a new MSC and/or new SGSN, UE 2 will not respond to MSC 2\\'s paging. This will only become known to UE 1 when MSC 2\\'s \"no response to paging\" timer expires. Typically, an operator configures this timer with values in the range of 8 to 25 seconds. When this timer expires, it is quite likely that UE 2 will have \"call forward on not reachable\" set and so UE 1\\'s call will be diverted to a voice mail server. To avoid these problems, it seems important that the operator configures the UTRAN to minimise the number of video calls that lead to fallback to GERAN coverage and/or to configure the network such that geographically similar UTRAN and GERAN cells are in the same Routeing Area.\\r\\n\\r\\nb)\\tIn order to avoid useless handover attempts, the RNCs are frequently configured so that no GERAN neighbour cells are given to the mobile during a video call. This will slow down re-selection from 3G to 2G in the case of total loss of 3G coverage. Conversely, in many other scenarios the lack of 2G neighbour cells might force UE 2 to camp on the 3G cell for long enough for it to receive the paging for the voice call.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tOverall, the operator may need to adapt the neighbour cell lists provided in video calls on cell by cell basis and/or dependent upon whether or not combined 2G/3G MSCs AND combined SGSNs are in use.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.2\\tFuture enhancements\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.2.1\\tRRC behaviour following degradation of the video RAB\\n\\r\\nAdditional study may be beneficial on how to \\'synchronise\\' the release of the RRC connection in the RNC and in the mobile when the radio connection is degraded or lost. If synchronisation cannot be guaranteed then timers may be needed to delay the redial attempt by the A party.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.2.2\\tInteraction with voice mail servers\\n\\r\\nIf a redial attempt is unsuccessful, it may (or may not) be appropriate to avoid being forwarded to a voice mail server.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne potential solution to this is that the A party signals (e.g. by appending a suffix to the dialled digits) to MSC-A and MSC-A then uses the Call Diversion Not Allowed setting in the Call Diversion Treatment Indicators to inhibit call forwarding. One problem with the use of a suffix in the dialled digits is that the digit analysis in MSC-A usually only examines the leading digits. Conversely, if the UE adds a prefix to the dialled digits, then the call will not be handled properly if MSC-A does not support this functionality.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4\\tFallback to voice during video call establishment\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4.1\\tSignalling flows and procedures\\n\\r\\nThe following diagram shows the various cases where video call establishment can fail or be unsuccessful.

And, MSC A sends a Call Proceeding message to UE A.\\r\\n\\r\\n3b.\\t(Failure case) The video call fails because of lack of radio resources on the A side. MSC A sends a Release Complete message (e.g. with cause #47, Resources unavailable, unspecified) to UE A. The RRC connection is released.

The user of UE B may choose not to accept the video call and either Reject the call or indicate User Determined User Busy. UE B then sends a Disconnect message (with cause #21, Call rejected or cause #17, User busy) to MSC B. MSC B sends a REL message to MSC A. MSC A sends a Disconnect message (with cause #21, Call rejected or cause #17, User busy) to UE A. The RRC connections are released. UE A can then prompt the user to initiate a voice call to UE B.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany other cause values can be returned to UE A in the Disconnect/Release Complete messages. It is a matter of UE implementation as to whether or not these cause values are used to prompt the user to initiate a re-dial.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE:\\tThere is no cause value that the user of UE B can use to decline the video call but indicate that they might accept a voice call.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf (following a failed video call establishment attempt) the UE prompts the user to initiate a Redial, and, the user requests the Redial attempt, then, the resulting SETUP message should carry extra information to indicate that it is a redial attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4.2\\tFuture enhancements\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4.2.1\\tHow to detect that a voice call might be successful?\\n\\r\\nThere are many reasons (User Determined User Busy, Barring of all incoming calls, an existing active video call) why a video call and a re-dialled voice call might both be unsuccessful. It would be useful if the rejection for the video call carried information that helped UE A to determine whether or not a subsequent voice call might succeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE:\\tFor UDUB, the A party will have received the Alerting message prior to the release message.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.4.2.2\\tHow to avoid video mail box problems?\\n\\r\\nCan users of video phones be provided with a full suite of supplementary services, e.g. can automatic forwarding to a video mail box when not in UMTS coverage be performed? Analysis of the current Call Forwarding specifications (TS\\xa022.082\\xa0[10], TS\\xa023.082\\xa0[11]) shows that MSC B should reject the call rather than forward it (because the UE is reachable but is not busy and has not been offered the chance to reply).\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce a video call has been stored by the mailbox, it can only be retrieved from the mailbox when the UE is in coverage that allows for a 64kbit/s bearer. As long as the UE is not in such a coverage area it cannot receive the video call from the mailbox.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne potential solution to this is that the mailbox provides a voice call comprising only the audio part of the video call. An alternative is that the user deactivates all call forwarding for video calls (c.f. CS data calls).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.5\\tAutomatic upgrade to video following fallback to voice\\n\\r\\nThis appears difficult to achieve in an automatic manner. However, given the privacy issues associated with automatic switching from voice to video, this does not appear to be a serious deficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor manual switching, good indications of UTRAN coverage, and, its ability (or not) to handle 64 kbit/s video would be useful. This is the same requirement as described in clause\\xa04.2.2.1.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\tInteraction with Supplementary Services and other 3GPP Features\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n5.1\\tGeneral\\n\\r\\nWithin the 3GPP specifications the CS video call is regarded as a Bearer Service and not a Teleservice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnex\\xa0A of TS\\xa022.004\\xa0[5] defines the applicability of supplementary services to both \"Telephony\" (a Teleservice) and \"cct data\" (Bearer Services).\\r\\n\\r\\nMost supplementary services are applicable to both the voice and video calls. For this \\'redial\\' solution to function effectively, the user and operator needs to configure supplementary services and network features (such as ODB and Roaming Restrictions) in a sensible manner (e.g. avoid barring voice calls but permit video calls). Sensible configurations do not seem to be prohibited by the standard.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is worth noting that some supplementary services cannot be used while in the video component of a call (e.g. Call Hold; Multiparty; Explicit Call Transfer and Calling Name Presentation).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n5.2\\tCalling Line Identity and Single Numbering Scheme\\n\\r\\nTo make this feature work smoothly, CLIs should not be restricted by the user, and, CLIs should be transferred by the networks. In addition, single numbering schemes should be used (i.e. the user\\'s videophone and telephone numbers need to be the same).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen detecting that a redialled call is the same as the original, the terminating UE should be aware that the number format might change from, for example, national to international format. This could be because the networks route the voice and video calls differently, or, because the terminating UE was the original A party.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe impacts of CAMEL based number translation services, e.g. for office VPNs are for further study.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n5.3\\tCAMEL based services triggered by call release and CCBS\\n\\r\\nRelease of the call can trigger other services, for example, voice mail delivery attempts and/or Call Completion to a Busy Subscriber. These services should have been designed to permit customers to make \\'one call followed by another\\', however, increased usage of closely coupled calls might mean that these other services need re-tuning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n5.4\\tProvision of Multi-Media \"Ring Back\" tones to the A party\\n\\r\\nWhen initiating a video call, the terminating network might provide \"multi-media\" content to the A party while attempting to contact the B party.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to achieve this, a bi-directional user plane is needed between the A party and the terminating network, i.e., the Connect message must have been sent. In this situation, the original video call establishment has been successful, and, as such, there is no need to \"redial as a voice call\".\\r\\n\\r\\nHow the terminating network transfers the established video call to the \"real B party\" is a matter for the terminating network (e.g. with regard to H.324 codec negotiation matters).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\tO+M, charging and inter-operator and roaming accounting\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n6.1\\tCall Detail Records and statistics\\n\\r\\nWith this redial mechanism, the voice and video calls are totally separate. Hence each should be able to use the existing CDR and billing machinery without modification.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it is worth noting that the billing system will probably not be able to provide any correlation between video and voice components of the same call.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe easy ability to switch between voice and video calls may have an impact on, for example, calculations of \\'mean call holding time\\' if this is calculated from CDRs. As a consequence there may be a need to add extra information onto the CDRs to indicate the reason for release/reason for establishment of a call.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn particular, it would be valuable to know the proportion of redial attempts that were successful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe addition of \"reason for establishment\" requires extra TS\\xa024.008\\xa0[7] signalling from the mobile. It is recommended that such changes to the TS\\xa024.008\\xa0[7] signalling should be made in this release of the specification.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn MSC generates call statistics information from its locally available release information.  Some of the abnormal releases on the B party side may be seen only as normal releases on the A party side as some problems of B party side are not signalled between MSCs. Therefore, the probability of the different B party problems has to be taken into account when the statistics for A party side is evaluated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn MSC may collect call statistics information from video calls for:\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\tunsuccessful mobile originating video call setup because 64 kbit/s RAB is currently not available;\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\tunsuccessful mobile terminating video call setup because 64 kbit/s RAB is currently not available;\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\tunsuccessful mobile originating video call setup because of lack of video service support by the UE;\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\tunsuccessful mobile terminating video call setup because of lack of video service support by the network;\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\tunsuccessful mobile originating video call setup because UE or network do not support video call;\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\tdisrupted video calls because of loss of the radio connection;\\r\\n\\r\\nand, if TS\\xa024.008\\xa0[7] is upgraded, the MSC can collect statistics for:\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\tthe number of mobile originating video call attempts indicating redial;\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\tthe number of mobile originating voice call attempts indicating redial.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, it is recommended that a \"redial flag\" is an optional parameter in the CDR produced for Mobile Originated calls as specified in TS\\xa032.205\\xa0[9].\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n6.2\\tOnline charging\\n\\r\\nWith this redial mechanism, the voice and video calls are totally separate. Hence each should be able to use the existing pre-pay mechanisms without modification.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n6.3\\tTariffing\\n\\r\\nWith this redial mechanism, each call will be subject to its own tariffs. If \\'per second\\' charging is in operation this should not matter. However if \"per minute\" billing is used, a customer might be slightly disappointed with the charge raised following 20 seconds of voice communication and 40 seconds of video communication.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n6.4\\tInter-operator accounting\\n\\r\\nWith this redial mechanism, the voice and video calls are totally separate. Hence there should be no impact on existing inter-operator agreements for either voice or for video calls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n6.5\\tRoaming accounting\\n\\r\\nWith this redial mechanism, the voice and video calls are totally separate. Hence there should be no impact on existing roaming agreements for either voice or for video calls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nAnnex A:\\nList of CRs needed to other TSs\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nA.1\\tGeneral\\n\\r\\nThe functionality that is described in this TR is based on the R\\'99 core specifications, plus, some additional CRs already agreed in later releases, plus, some CRs that have yet to be drafted and/or agreed by TSG Plenaries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nA.2\\tCRs to other specifications already agreed by TSG Plenaries\\n\\r\\nThese CRs are believed to include (and believed to be limited to):\\r\\n\\r\\na)\\tFrom release 6, CR 287r3 to TS\\xa044.018\\xa0[2] (see GP-040518) and CR 198r4 to TS\\xa045.008\\xa0[6] (see GP-040542).

However there are additional complications:\\r\\n\\r\\na)\\tIf the UTRAN and GERAN cells are attached to different MSCs then problems are likely to occur due to the time required for the UE 2 to perform Location Area and Routeing Area updating.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn particular, if UE 2 is updating with a new MSC and/or new SGSN, UE 2 will not respond to MSC 2\\'s paging. This will only become known to UE 1 when MSC 2\\'s \"no response to paging\" timer expires. Typically, an operator configures this timer with values in the range of 8 to 25 seconds. When this timer expires, it is quite likely that UE 2 will have \"call forward on not reachable\" set and so UE 1\\'s call will be diverted to a voice mail server. To avoid these problems, it seems important that the operator configures the UTRAN to minimise the number of video calls that lead to fallback to GERAN coverage and/or to configure the network such that geographically similar UTRAN and GERAN cells are in the same Routeing Area.\\r\\n\\r\\nb)\\tIn order to avoid useless handover attempts, the RNCs are frequently configured so that no GERAN neighbour cells are given to the mobile during a video call. This will slow down re-selection from 3G to 2G in the case of total loss of 3G coverage. Conversely, in many other scenarios the lack of 2G neighbour cells might force UE 2 to camp on the 3G cell for long enough for it to receive the paging for the voice call.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tOverall, the operator may need to adapt the neighbour cell lists provided in video calls on cell by cell basis and/or dependent upon whether or not combined 2G/3G MSCs AND combined SGSNs are in use.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.2\\tFuture enhancements\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n4.3.2.1\\tRRC behaviour following degradation of the video RAB\\n\\r\\nAdditional study may be beneficial on how to \\'synchronise\\' the release of the RRC connection in the RNC and in the mobile when the radio connection is degraded or lost.

In this situation, the original video call establishment has been successful, and, as such, there is no need to \"redial as a voice call\".\\r\\n\\r\\nHow the terminating network transfers the established video call to the \"real B party\" is a matter for the terminating network (e.g. with regard to H.324 codec negotiation matters).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\tO+M, charging and inter-operator and roaming accounting\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n6.1\\tCall Detail Records and statistics\\n\\r\\nWith this redial mechanism, the voice and video calls are totally separate.

As a consequence there may be a need to add extra information onto the CDRs to indicate the reason for release/reason for establishment of a call.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn particular, it would be valuable to know the proportion of redial attempts that were successful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe addition of \"reason for establishment\" requires extra TS\\xa024.008\\xa0[7] signalling from the mobile. It is recommended that such changes to the TS\\xa024.008\\xa0[7] signalling should be made in this release of the specification.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn MSC generates call statistics information from its locally available release information.  Some of the abnormal releases on the B party side may be seen only as normal releases on the A party side as some problems of B party side are not signalled between MSCs.
