        "content": "\nsummary:Summary:\n\nThe document outlines the Idle Mode Redial mechanism, which enables seamless switching between voice and video services in 3GPP-based systems. This mechanism allows users to switch between voice and video modes during an established call or when radio conditions change, facilitating user-friendly service transitions.\n\nKey components include:\n1) Switching modes (voice to video or vice versa) while maintaining the same recipient.\n2) Video call termination for degraded radio coverage, allowing a voice call attempt instead.\n3) Automatic voice call establishment if initial video call setup fails.\n\nOptimization of the Man Machine Interface (MMI) in user equipment is crucial. Trade-offs between 'speed of redial' and interactions with content servers supporting only video calls may occur. The document also discusses supplementary services, their applicability to both telephony and bearer services, and configurations needed for effective operation.\n\nThe mechanism allows separate handling of voice and video calls without altering existing billing systems but may introduce difficulties correlating components across different billing systems. Additional signaling might be required in call detail records (CDRs) following specific guidelines.\n\nChallenges include accurate collection of call statistics due to potential discrepancies between B-party issues not fully signaled between MSCs, impacting A-party evaluations. Upgrading core specifications could facilitate better statistics collection on redial attempts for both voice and video calls.\n\nIntroducing a \"redial flag\" in CDRs for mobile-originated calls might enhance transparency regarding call retries but could affect customer expectations under different billing models. The document also highlights updates from SP-26 to SP-88E, detailing versions 2.0.0 to 18.0.0 with each update corresponding to a new release (Rel-7 through Rel-18).",

Following verbal dialogue between User 1 and User 2, they agree that a switch to video is likely to be successful (e.g. because both User 1 and User 2 have video capable handsets, and, they both have \"using 3G\" indications visible on their screens). The User of UE 2 pushes the \"switch to video\" button (or uses other MMI that provides the same functionality) and UE 2 stores the CLI of UE 1 for use in step 7.\nNOTE 1:\tIf UE 1 (instead of UE 2) initiated the \"switch to video\", then UE 1 stores the previously dialled number for use in step 7.\n1)\tUE 2 releases the voice call.\n2)\tMSC 2 sends a RELEASE message with the release cause. The cause value in the RELEASE message might be changed by transit networks prior to arrival at MSC 1.\n3)\tMSC 1 sends a RELEASE COMPLETE message to MSC 2.\n4)\tMSC 1 releases the voice call with UE 1.\n5)\tMSC 2 and MSC 1 locally release the Iu connections to RNC 2 and RNC 1 (assuming that there are no other CM connections active). RNC 2 and RNC 1 then release the RRC connections (assuming that their mobiles are not in PMM connected state).\n\tIn order to minimise idle tasks performed by the UE, the following should be performed by Operators which preferentially camp UEs on UMTS:\n\tthe BSC should include the \"Cell selection indicator after release of all TCH and SDCCH\" IE in the Channel Release message (see TS 44.018 [2]) if the release is done on a GERAN cell and the call was not started on this BSC and the local 2G and 3G cells are in different RAs.\nNOTE 2:\tThe above text does mean RA. Change of LA always involves change of RA.\n6)\tUE 2 and UE 1 camp on suitable cells and perform the required idle mode tasks.\n7)\tUE 2 initiates RRC connection setup and sends the Setup message for the video call to MSC 2. The Called Party number is the one stored in step 0. The Setup message should carry extra information to indicate that it is the result of a redial attempt.\n8)\tMSC 2 requests the allocation of radio resources.\n\tIf the GERAN does not support CS video, then the MSC 2 shall send an A interface Assignment Request message to the BSC including the Service Handover IE set to \"Handover to UTRAN or cdma2000 should be performed\" and a Channel Type indicating any value acceptable to the BSC. The BSS handles the Assignment Request message as defined in TS 48.008 [3]. The interactions between MSC server and MGW can be minimised if the A interface circuit is not allocated. This can be achieved by setting the Channel Type = signalling. The interactions between the MSC server and the MGW are defined in TS 23.205 [12].\n\tIf the GERAN does support CS video then the MSC 2 should send an A interface Assignment Request message to the BSC including the relevant channel type. The BSS proceeds as defined in TS 48.008 [3].\n9)\tIf radio resource allocation was successful, the IAM message is sent to MSC 1 and the Call Proceeding message is sent to UE 2.\n10)\tMSC 1 pages UE 1. UE 1 responds by establishing an RRC connection and sending the Paging Response message to MSC 1 within the RRC-Initial Direct Transfer and RANAP-Initial UE messages. MSC 1 then sends the Setup message for the video call to UE 1. The Setup message carries the CLI of UE 2.\n11) UE 1 confirms its capability to handle the video call in the Call Confirmed message and MSC 1 requests the allocation of radio resources.\n\tIf UE 1 responded to paging by establishing an RR connection on a GERAN cell, then MSC 1 initiates handover to UTRAN as described in step 8.\n12)\tIf the radio resource allocation was successful, UE 1 sends an Alerting message to MSC 1. MSC 1 sends the ACM message to MSC 2 and MSC 2 sends the Alerting message to UE 2.\n13)\tUser 1 answers the video call. For privacy reasons, the \"switch to video\" and \"switch to voice\" answer functions should not be automated.\n14)\tThe video call is established.\nWith obvious small differences, some of which are described above, the above procedure is also used for switching from a video call to a voice call.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen \"redial-switching\" from a video call to a voice call, the voice call Setup message should carry the extra information to indicate that it is a redial attempt.\n",

However there are additional complications:\na)\tIf the UTRAN and GERAN cells are attached to different MSCs then problems are likely to occur due to the time required for the UE 2 to perform Location Area and Routeing Area updating.\n\tIn particular, if UE 2 is updating with a new MSC and/or new SGSN, UE 2 will not respond to MSC 2's paging. This will only become known to UE 1 when MSC 2's \"no response to paging\" timer expires. Typically, an operator configures this timer with values in the range of 8 to 25 seconds. When this timer expires, it is quite likely that UE 2 will have \"call forward on not reachable\" set and so UE 1's call will be diverted to a voice mail server. To avoid these problems, it seems important that the operator configures the UTRAN to minimise the number of video calls that lead to fallback to GERAN coverage and/or to configure the network such that geographically similar UTRAN and GERAN cells are in the same Routeing Area.\nb)\tIn order to avoid useless handover attempts, the RNCs are frequently configured so that no GERAN neighbour cells are given to the mobile during a video call. This will slow down re-selection from 3G to 2G in the case of total loss of 3G coverage. Conversely, in many other scenarios the lack of 2G neighbour cells might force UE 2 to camp on the 3G cell for long enough for it to receive the paging for the voice call.\n\tOverall, the operator may need to adapt the neighbour cell lists provided in video calls on cell by cell basis and/or dependent upon whether or not combined 2G/3G MSCs AND combined SGSNs are in use.\n",

Analysis of the current Call Forwarding specifications (TS 22.082 [10], TS 23.082 [11]) shows that MSC B should reject the call rather than forward it (because the UE is reachable but is not busy and has not been offered the chance to reply).\nOnce a video call has been stored by the mailbox, it can only be retrieved from the mailbox when the UE is in coverage that allows for a 64kbit/s bearer. As long as the UE is not in such a coverage area it cannot receive the video call from the mailbox.\nOne potential solution to this is that the mailbox provides a voice call comprising only the audio part of the video call. An alternative is that the user deactivates all call forwarding for video calls (c.f. CS data calls).\n",
